% function [popmean, pcs, standardDev, individualMeans] = populationModelParameters(patientData, nComponents)
% Calculate the parameters, i.e. the prinicpal components and their
% variance, as well as the population mean, of a population deformation
% model.
% Input arguments:
%  patientData: struct array containing the point data for all patients.
%               each element in the array represents one patient, and each
%               patient must have a set of structures represented by the
%               cell array "contourPoints". In this cell array, each cell
%               represents an organ shape from that patient. The shape is
%               represented by an N by 3 array, where N is the number of
%               points, each of which has three spatial coordinates.
%
%  nComponents: Number of principal components to output. If not given, all
%               PCs with nonzero variance are given. This is equal to 
%               the total number of shapes minus the number of patients.         
%  
%
% Output arguments:
%  popmean: Population mean shape vector
%  pcs: Matrix of principal components. Each column represents one principal
%  component
%  standardDev: vector containing the standard deviation of each principal
%  component. Ordered in descending fashion.
