%function [avg, pcs, stddev] = patientSpecificModelParameters(data, npcs)
%
% Calculate the parameters, i.e. the prinicpal components and their
% variance, as well as the patient mean, of a patient-specific deformation
% model.
% Input parameters:
%  data:        cell arraystruct array containing the point data for all
%               shapes for this patient. Each cell represents an organ 
%               shape from the patient. The shape is represented by an
%               N by 3 array, where N is the number of points, each of
%               which has three spatial coordinates.
%
%  nComponents: Number of principal components to output. If not given, all
%               PCs with nonzero variance are given. This is equal to 
%               the total number of shapes minus one.         
%  
%
% Output parameters:
%  avg: Mean shape vector
%  pcs: Matrix of principal components. Each column represents one principal
%  component
%  standardDev: vector containing the standard deviation of each principal
%  component. In descending order.
